1) Inspect the deployment and identify the number of PODs deployed by it

  **kubectl describe pods**

2) What container image is used to deploy the applications?

 **kubectl describe deployment**



3) Let us try that. Upgrade the application by setting the image on the deployment to kodekloud/webapp-color:v2 .Do not delete and re-create the deployment. Only set the new image name for the existing deployment.


**kubectl edit deployment frontend** 



4) Up to how many PODs can be down for upgrade at a time.Consider the current strategy settings and number of PODs - 4


**kubectl describe deployment frontend**
