1) How many PODs exist on the system?

**kubectl get pods**


2) How many ReplicaSets exist on the system?

**kubectl get replicaset**

3) How about now? How many ReplicaSets do you see? We just made a few changes!

**kubectl get replicaset**


4) How many PODs are DESIRED in the new-replica-set?

**kubectl get replicaset**


5) What is the image used to create the pods in the new-replica-set?

 **kubectl describe replicaset**



6) How many PODs are READY in the new-replica-set?

 **kubectl get replicaset**


7) Delete any one of the 4 PODs.

 **kubectl get pods**


 **kubectl delete pod <replicaset name>**



8) How many PODs exist now?

 **kubectl get pods**


9) Create a ReplicaSet using the replicaset-definition-1.yaml

  **kubectl create -f replicaset-definition-1.yaml**



10) Fix the issue in the replicaset-definition-2.yaml file and create a ReplicaSet using it.

**kubectl create -f replicaset-definition-2.yaml** 



 11) Delete the two newly created ReplicaSets - replicaset-1 and replicaset-2

  **kubectl delete -f replicaset-definition-1.yaml** 



 **kubectl delete -f replicaset-definition-2.yaml** 



 12) Fix the original replica set new-replica-set to use the correct busybox image.

  **kubectl edit replicaset new-replica-set** 


13) Scale the ReplicaSet to 5 PODs.

 **kubectl scale rs new-replica-set --replicas=5**


14) Now scale the ReplicaSet down to 2 PODs.

**kubectl scale rs new-replica-set --replicas=2**
